            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Born and raised in Richmond, VA - I have always had a passion for combining artwork with technololgy and problem solving. Currently, I am graduate student studying Experience Design at the VCU Brandcenter. In this program, I am learning UX/UI Design, Front-end Developement, and Branding. I graduated in 2023 from Virginia Tech with a degree in Multimedia Journalism and a minor in Creative Writing.</p>
            <p>My passion for design and developement started at a young age when I became obssessed with creating the perfect UI for my character in World of Wacraft. Later, I combined my love for computers and design by teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so that I could create my own websites from conception, all the way to deployment. Through school and my own curiosity, I am continuing to hone my design and coding skills. I also currently work as a Freelance Designer and Developer, so hit me up for all your website and app needs!</p>
            <p>When I am not at my computer, you can find me at the gym, reading manga, watching anime, or drawing. In my freetime, I work on writing a fantasy novel with my older brother. Ask me about the time I got stranded in Kyoto, Japan!</p>
